  <h2>5.8.24 - hello world</h2>
  <p>hi everyone!
    today, i finally got around to messing around with github pages. this post won't be a longread of any sorts - just a
    simple introduction.
    my name is seo and i've been poking at tech since i was a little kid. i've recently got into coding, in a language called
    shell script, to automatize some work i do on my machine.
    personally, i like the language very much, but you can't get much farther than simple text editing in shell (atleast afaik).
    as such, i've recently purchased a couple of books to get to learn some languages i'm interested in, and my picks were C,
    Python and Lua. the langs seem appealing, readable and mostly new user-friendly, which i'm very glad about.
    soon, this page will probably have more screenshots of my setup, my progress in ricing, coding and web design.
    thanks for sticking with me, and peace!
    -seo
  </p>
